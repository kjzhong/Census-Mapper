Dear Team G,

Here is the qualitative feedback for your group assignment.

-----

## Deliverable 1. Codebase

This part was marked by the teaching team.

> _"Wonderful work. It was great to see the efforts you made to simplify shapes, as well as additional efforts to clean and standardise the dataset.
This was an excellent codebase significantly above and beyond the expectations of the course."_

-----

## Deliverable 2. Presentation

This part was marked by the teaching team ("Editor") with inputs from the student peer reviewers ("Reviewer 1", "Reviewer 2").

### Part 1 – Explanation of product/service relative to locations

Editor **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, definitely)**:

> _"Thank you for your efforts. Your team explained that you intend to address transport disadvantages through autonomous taxis, particularly: • Difficulty accessing transport due to cost • Availability of services •	Difficulty of maintaining car ownership. Your team provided good evidence - Currie & Senbergs 2007 – 9 groups of people who are transport disadvantaged Group outlined that autonomous vehicles result in 44% less crashes, and disadvantages outlined by particular groups. Overall – good evidence and logic."_

Reviewer 1 **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, somewhat)**:

> _"The team spent time defining what “transport disadvantage” is. They also defined the value proposition and target audience. The depth of their justifications somewhat exceeded the requirements."_

Reviewer 2 **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, brilliantly)**:

> _"This group has provided us with statistic about the context explaining why they pick this product. Identify group of people who are experiencing the issue on transportation."_

### Part 2 – Recommendations and justifications for locations

Editor **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, definitely)**:

> _"Your team decided to focus on areas with high proportions of disabled people, senior citizens, and indigenous people. Your team provided detailed reasoning for particular locations. Near end of presentation, you explained equal-weighted score for comparing locations through z-score (this is good logic and justification)."_

Reviewer 1 **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, definitely)**:

> _"Concise analysis of target audience and segments with good justification as to why transportation is unequal across the specified locations. Locations are selected on regions with high proportions of senior, disabled and indigenous clusters. Demonstration of clear understanding of the application of the product and impact on the communities highlighted. Furthermore, they highlighted the greater need by providing quantifiable evidence for each postcode linking to feasible perception of the effect of their services. Also the group evaluated the postcodes based on more than 1 criteria with a business aspect in mind."_

Reviewer 2 **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, definitely)**:

> _"Firstly, target audiences are identified, seniors, indigenous, disable people. A very intuitive interactive map is shown, each location is labelled by colour from green to red."_

### Part 3 – Demonstration of codebase

Editor **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, definitely)**:

> _"Your team explained how standardized data, explained the steps taken with snippets of code, and provided a demo of your web app."_

Reviewer 1 **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, brilliantly)**:

> _"Leaflet: • Effective implementation of key functions of leaflet maps and choropleths with a popup to indicate percentile values • Functional dropdown menu/search bar to switch between multiple Chloropeth maps • Concise explanation of the role of HTML, Javascript and CSS in the structure of the app • One suggestion to improve the leaflet app include a clearer description of the percentile values in the popup. Python: • Displayed ability to read and join relevant csv data files • Effective functions to aggregate relevant columns for data cleaning • Standardised to ensure effective comparison • Use of average functions • Cleaning of data to remove “POA” from postcode columns etc. • Effective function to calculate colours for display in Chloropeth • Implemented scoring system based on numerous variables"_


Reviewer 2 **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, definitely)**:

> _"The team has clearly explained the codebase by showing the CSV files they used and how they used it, and how they processed the data by showing the formula they used in python. Team also showed HTML, CSS, JS on how they created their map showing the three locations."_

### Part 4 – Overall Clarity and Professionalism

Editor **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, definitely)**:

> _"Very polished demonstration!"_

Reviewer 1 **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, definitely)**:

> _"• Despite a small audio issue at the beginning, group delivered a pitch that was well-structured and had a smooth transition between team members • The group delivered the pitch within the 10-minute time limit. • The group communicated their ideas in a professional manner, balancing text with very strong visualisations of choropleths which added clarity. • The group’s concept showed promise in lowering regional inequality by selecting areas with high proportions of senior, disabled and indigenous people."_


Reviewer 2 **(Did the team exceed the requirements? Yes, brilliantly)**:

> _"The team remained professional tone despite the technical issues and the pitch was convincing on why their product/service must be implemented."_



Thank you for your efforts this term in INFS2822! :)

Kind regards,
